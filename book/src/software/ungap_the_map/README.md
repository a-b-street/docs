# Ungap the Map: envisioning better bike networks

Ever want to visualize how your city would look if streets were designed to
safely/comfortably make most trips by bike? This tool lets you quickly sketch
out your own vision to fill in missing gaps in the network, see how the changes
would impact your commute, and share the results with others.

- [Web version](http://play.abstreet.org/0.3.43/abstreet.html?--ungap&system/us/seattle/maps/central_seattle.bin)
- To work for larger areas (like all of Seattle), it's highly recommend to
  install the [latest release](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/releases)
  for Windows, Mac, or Linux. After unzipping, run `ungap_the_map.sh` or
  `ungap_the_map.bat`.

## Credits

This project was inspired by conversations with members of Seattle Neighborhood
Greenways, who had feedback about the main A/B Street traffic simulation being
too open-ended. This was developed
[during August-October 2021](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/743)
for the Taiwan presidential hackathon. This tool is part of A/B Street, which
has had [many contributors](../../project/team.md), but specifically for this
tool:

- Dustin Carlino: primary creator
- [Michael Kirk](https://github.com/michaelkirk): usability feedback and fixes,
  ideas for what the tool should do, implemented road labels and large parts of
  the lane editor
- [Mara Cruz](https://www.mara-cruz.com/): part-time UX help, connections to
  NYC's advocacy group
- [Robin Lovelace](https://www.robinlovelace.net/): domain knowledge about
  [mode shift](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/448)
- [Yuwen Li](https://www.yuwen-li.com/): A/B Street's main UX designer. Not
  directly involved in this tool, but the design is largely adapted from her
  prior work
- the [Aurora Reimagined Coalition](https://got99problems.org) for letting us
  bring a prototype to a design workshop event
- contributors from the
  [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.democracylab.org/events/ndoch-2021)
- [Eldan Goldenberg](https://eldang.xyz/): prior work on
  [elevation data](https://github.com/eldang/elevation_lookups)
- the [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/about) community
- Angelina and Amanda, DemocracyLab volunteers, for participating in usability
  studies
- the organizers of the
  [Taiwan hackathon](https://presidential-hackathon.taiwan.gov.tw/en/international-track/)
  for providing motivation and direction for the project
