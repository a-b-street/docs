# Bike network visioning

Ever want to visualize how your city would look if streets were designed to
safely/comfortably make most trips by bike? This tool lets you quickly sketch
out your own vision to fill in missing gaps in the network, see how the changes
would impact your commute, and share the results with others.

## Credits

This project was inspired by conversations with members of Seattle Neighborhood
Greenways, who had feedback about the main A/B Street traffic simulation being
too open-ended. This was developed
[during August-October 2021](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/743)
for the Taiwan presidential hackathon. This tool is part of A/B Street, which
has had [many contributors](../../project/team.md), but specifically for this
tool:

- Dustin Carlino: primary creator
- Michael Kirk: usability feedback, ideas for what the tool should do,
  implemented road labels and large parts of the lane editor
- Yuwen Li: A/B Street's main UX designer. Not directly involved in this tool,
  but the design is largely adapted from her prior work
- Mara Cruz: part-time UX help, connections to NYC's advocacy group
- Robin Lovelace: domain knowledge about
  [mode shift](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/448).
