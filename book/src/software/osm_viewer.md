# OpenStreetMap viewer

- [Web version](http://play.abstreet.org/0.3.34/osm_viewer.html)
- To run locally, get the
  [latest release](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/releases) for Windows,
  Mac, or Linux. After unzipping, run `osm_viewer.exe` or `osm_viewer`.

A separate tool that visualizes OpenStreetMap data, with details on lanes, turn
restrictions, parking lot capacity, and road width. It's also very convenient to
explore the raw attributes on roads. The
[OSM Connect 2020 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUN5GWfb4Qo) talks about
possible directions for this viewer.
