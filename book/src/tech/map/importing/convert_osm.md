# From OSM to RawMap (`convert_osm` crate)

The first phase of map building reads in data from OSM files and a few others,
producing a serialized `RawMap`.

Only major steps are described; see the code for the rest.

## extract.rs

Read .osm, extracting the points for road-like ways, buildings, and areas

- Areas usually come from a relation of multiple ways, with the points out of
  order. Gluing all the points together fails when the .osm has some ways
  clipped out. In that case, try to trace along the map boundary if the partial
  area intersects the boundary in a clear way. Otherwise, just use a straight
  line to try to close off the polygon.
- Also read traffic signal locations and turn restrictions between OSM ways

## split_ways.rs

Split OSM ways into road segments

- OSM ways cross many intersections, so treat points with multiple ways and the
  points at the beginning and end of a way as intersections, then split the way
  into road segments between two intersections.
- This phase remembers which road segment is the beginning and end of the OSM
  way, for per-lane turn restrictions later
- Apply turn restrictions between roads here. Since OSM ways cross many
  intersections, the turn restrictions only apply to one particular road segment
  that gets created from the way. Make sure the destination of the restriction
  is actually incident to a particular source road.

## clip

Clip the map to the boundary polygon

- `osmium` options preserve ways that cross the boundary
- Trim roads that cross the boundary. There may be cases where a road dips out
  of bounds, then immediately comes back in. Disconnecting it isn't ideal, but
  it's better to manually tune the boundary polygon when this happens than try
  to preserve lots of out-of-bounds geometry.
- Area polygons are intersected with the boundary polygon using the `clipping`
  crate
