- July: loads of bugfixes, map geometry improvements, UI cleanups,
  access-restricted zones for private neighborhoods and no-through-traffic,
  better traffic generation between home<->work for new maps, complete overhaul
  to bus routes and introduction of light rail, commute pattern explorer,
  importing Krakow and Berlin, smarter lane-changing, walkable shoulders for
  roads without sidewalks
  - [KING 5 Evening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk8V-egsUxU) interview
- August: Michael joins, multiple traffic signals can be edited together,
  started a headless JSON API, support for other languages in OSM data, started
  congestion capping, backwards-compatible and more robust map edits, two-way
  cycletracks, more cities imported, slurry of bugfixes and performance
  improvements

- September: full support for driving on the left, textured color scheme,
  rendering isometric buildings, editing traffic signal offsets, a big round of
  UI changes, infinite parking mode, trip purpose, alleyways
  - [SeattleMet](https://www.seattlemet.com/news-and-city-life/2020/09/a-new-game-allows-you-to-redesign-seattle-streets)
- October: unit tested turn generation, web version launched with async file
  loading, thought bubbles showing agent goals, slow parts of a trip
  highlighted, more UI overhauls, dedicated OSM viewer mode started, major
  simulation performance optimizations, major progress towards live map edits,
  automatically picking boundaries for arbitrary cities
- November: switched from Dropbox to S3, download new maps in-game, collision
  dataviz UI, day/night color switching, unit testing lane changing behavior,
  starting the 15 min walkshed tool, simplified simulation spawning code,
  recording and replaying traffic around a few intersections, refactoring to
  split out separate tools
- December: lane-changing fixes, blocked-by explorer in debug mode, non-Latin
  font support on web, saving player state on web, census-based scenario
  generation started, 15 minute Santa
- January: experimented with SUMO import, UI button overhaul, day/night mode,
  first separate cycleways
- February: better web loading and URL sharing, randomized parking,
  procedurally generated houses, actdev integration, geofabrik picker, new day
  theme, static routing penalties
- March: UK flow-based scenario generation, roundabout gridlock fixes, UI panel
  redesign, one-step OSM importer with UI, elevation data & layers
- April: pathfinding by roads, editing number of lanes, risk exposure, Tempe
  intersection consolidation
- May: GMNS signal timing import, cloud map importer, OSM turn lane fixes
- June: performance, first dynamic vehicle lane-changing, exiting driveways
  off-sides and across multiple lanes
- July: pathfinding refactor, Broadmoor blog post, mode shift tool, massive
  intersection consolidation breakthrough, deduplicating cycleways in OSM, bike
  lane separators, new day mode colors
