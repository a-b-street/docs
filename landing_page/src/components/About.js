        A/B Street is a project to plan, simulate, and communicate visions for making cities friendlier to people walking, biking, and taking public transit.
        We create software to simulate traffic, edit streets and intersections, plan bike networks, create low-traffic neighborhoods, and educate the public about urban design through games.
        The project works anywhere in the world, thanks to OpenStreetMap üó∫Ô∏è.
        <br /><br />We amplify the efforts of those transitioning cities towards active transportation üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö∏üöá, by:
          <ol>
            <li>Providing transparent & reproducible analysis - our work is open source and based on public data.</li>
            <li>Amplifying the voices of local residents to shape their city - our software is designed for ease of use.</li>
          </ol>

          Why not leave city planning to professionals? People are local experts on their slice of the city, from that one left turn lane that always backs up or intersection with poorly timed walk signals. Laura Adler writes:
          <br /><br /><i><b>"Only with simple, accessible simulation programs can citizens become active generators of their own urban visions, not just passive recipients of options laid out by government officials."</b></i>
